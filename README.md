# Weatherly

# Weather App with Colorful Output and ASCII Art

## Overview

This Python script fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a beautiful format using dynamic ASCII art. The output includes colorful weather stats, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed, and is formatted with random ASCII styles such as `figlet` or `cowsay/cowthink`. This provides a fun and visually appealing way to check the weather.

## Features

- **Fetches weather data** using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Displays the weather stats** in a clean, readable format, including:
  - Temperature (in Fahrenheit)
  - Humidity
  - Wind Speed
- **Dynamic ASCII Art**: Displays the word "Weather" in a random style using:
  - `figlet` with a random font from available fonts.
  - `cowsay/cowthink` with random characters (like cow, dragon, tux, moose, and hellokitty).
- **Colorful Output**: Weather stats are shown in bright colors for clarity.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Python modules: `requests`, `subprocess`, `os`, and `random`
- External utilities: `figlet`, `cowsay`, `cowthink`

### Optional:
- Install `figlet` and `cowsay` for full functionality:
  - **On Ubuntu/Debian**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install figlet cowsay
    ```
  - **On macOS** (using Homebrew):
    ```bash

  - **On Arch Linux**:
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S figlet cowsay
    ```

    ```

3. **Ensure `figlet` and `cowsay` are installed** for full functionality (if they aren't already installed on your system).

## Usage

1. **Run the script**:

    ```bash
    python weather_app.py
    ```

2. **Enter the city name** when prompted to get the current weather for that city.
